# HELLO! This is backend, NestJS' name is quite literal here.

## nest g (desired file type) (desired directory path) : this command, when ran while in the backend/ path in your terminal working directory, will generate the file type to that directory and create the path if it does not exist. This is useful when creating a feature as this is essentially you creating a feature path for associated code.

/**
1. nest g module auth
2. nest g controller auth
3. nest g service auth

1.1 nest g module user
2.1 nest g controller user
3.1 nest g service user

This will generate:
	(1) •	auth/ folder with auth.controller.ts, auth.module.ts, auth.service.ts.
	(2) •	user/ folder with user.controller.ts, user.module.ts, user.service.ts.
