# HELLO! This is backend, NestJS' name is quite literal here.

## nest g (desired file type) (desired directory path) : this command, when ran while in the backend/ path in your terminal working directory, will generate the file type to that directory and create the path if it does not exist. This is useful when creating a feature as this is essentially you creating a feature path for associated code.

/**
nest g module auth
nest g controller auth
nest g service auth

nest g module user
nest g controller user
nest g service user

This will generate:
	•	auth/ folder with auth.controller.ts, auth.module.ts, auth.service.ts.
	•	user/ folder with user.controller.ts, user.module.ts, user.service.ts.
